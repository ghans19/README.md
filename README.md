Hi, everyone!

I am Gursimran, I'm a BA Journalism student from City, University of London, spending this year on exchange at Hong Kong Baptist University. I have not done much data journalism before.
I have done the odd bit of work analysing data but nothing much of the kind of work for this module. 

I have previously worked for The Sun, The Times, the BBC and a few student magazines/papers. You can see my full online portfolio here: http://www.gursimranhans.com/

I feel story telling is one of the most important tools we have. Everyone has a story to tell and from these stories, we can learn and improve. Being able to find those stories and tell them in an interesting and engaging way are the skills I must wish to develop.

I am not good at coding at all (never had the chance to develop these skills), but I'm willing to put the hours in to learn how to do it!

I would really like to do a story which highlights something that few people really talk about but does so in a way that can help improve life for people.
